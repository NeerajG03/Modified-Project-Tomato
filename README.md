# Modified-Project-Tomato
This is a modified Github project that uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to identify and classify healthy tomato plants. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can help farmers and gardeners detect diseases early on, prevent crop loss, and improve the overall health of their tomato plants.
