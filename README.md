# Modified-Project-Tomato
This is a modified Github project that uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to identify and classify healthy tomato plants. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can help farmers and gardeners detect diseases from the tomato leaves early on, prevent crop loss, and improve the overall health of their tomato plants.

## Steps to run
- All you need to run this project is a Google colab notebook.
- Here is the link to colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MtqiaRlYIEEUnt7zO3SdGoDpQ4oS0a9u?usp=sharing
- Make a copy of the file, You can do so by *File -> Save a copy on Drive*
